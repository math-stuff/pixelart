It looks like your Wednesday work has two cats, two dogs, and one tree. Remember that you can use the dashed rectangle tool on Piskel to select the dog, cat, or tree and then copy/paste any one of those to put them into the same frame. 

**Copy**: Hold CTRL, then press C. This will copy whatever you have boxed in, but will leave the original there. 

**Cut**: Hold CTRL, then press X (like a pair of scissors). This will copy whatever you have boxed in, and it will cut out the original.

After cutting or copying, you must move the rectangular box around to where you want to paste. You'll notice it shows the silhouette (or outline) of whatever you copied or cut. You **can** switch to a different frame, so you can copy the cat and put it next to the tree or vice versa.

**Paste**: Hold CTRL, then press V (like the tip of a glue bottle). This will paste whatever you copied over the current location of the rectangle.
