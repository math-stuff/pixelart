There is no clear line to copyright with what we call a "transformative work", but the "Handsome Squidward" file that was originally saved appears to have originated from a post online 2+ years ago. Since there weren't sufficient changes to the meme in your file, it hasn't been copied here. 

However, if it appeals to you, I do challenge you to change one of the template file heads to a minimalist form of Handsome Squidward. It's a smaller resolution, so you'd want to see if you can copy down the details yourself (or up the resolution a bit)
