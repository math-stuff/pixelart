Note how the mountain image below uses shading; it uses three shades of that teal color. The regions where it swaps from one color to the next aren't straight lines, but look toward the snow peak for guidance. Where does it swap from lightest to darkest? When does it swap from the darkest to the middle shade? The middle shade to the top?

While this one uses three shades, we can probably get away with just two for now, and that may help your picture pop!
