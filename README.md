Welcome to Pixel Art & Animation!

**Goal**: To create your own character/scene in Piskel.

**Color Palette**: Pixel art often works with an inherently small number of colors. This file provides these colors to us. 

1) Click on the Color Palette link. Then, right click the image and select "Save As". Give it a name.
2) Go to https://www.piskelapp.com and create a new Sprite.
3) In the bottom right, there is a section titled "Palettes". Click the pencil button to edit the color palettes.
4) While we can define our own, we want to import this one. At the top of the page, hit the "Import From File" button.
5) Select our Palette picture. Piskel will pull all colors from this picture and add them to our palette.
6) Hit Save
7) Our palette will now be availabe in the bottom right!

**Basic Templates**: A gif with six basic people templates is above as Basic Templates.gif

1) Click on the gif link. Then, right click the image and select "Save As". Give it a name.
2) On Piskel, we'll want to hit the IMPORT folders on the right hand side to import the image. Use IMPORT FROM PICTURE
3) Select the image of our choice (such as Basic Templates) and it will open the image in the app.
